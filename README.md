# Employee Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether an employee will leave the company (Attrition) using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Source
IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset (Kaggle)  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset

## Target Variable
Attrition  
- Yes = Employee leaves the company  
- No = Employee stays in the company  

## Steps Performed
- Data Loading & Understanding
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing (Encoding categorical values)
- Train-Test Split
- Feature Scaling
- Model Building and Evaluation

## Model Used
Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Accuracy Achieved
87.75%

## How to Run the Project
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle
2. Keep `employee_attrition.csv` in the project folder
3. Open `employee_attrition.ipynb`
4. Run all cells to train and test the model
